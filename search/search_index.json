A shell is a program that provides a user interface for the OS. When we're talking about PowerShell, the \"shell\" part usually refers to its command-line interface (CLI). A CLI is a basic user interface that lets you enter a command (or a series of commands) at a prompt.</p> <p>At first, a CLI might not seem as efficient as a graphical user interface (GUI) because you have to type in commands, making sure of spelling, spacing, quotes, etc. However, command shells have always supported some form of batch execution, which is also called scripting. A script is simply a list of commands stored in a text file you can execute on demand. PowerShell is no exception\u2014although PowerShell is an excellent CLI, it becomes even more flexible with the use of scripts. A PowerShell script is simply a text file with a .ps1 extension that contains a list of commands PowerShell should execute.</p> <p>However, PowerShell's secure by default philosophy prevents all scripts from running, so double-clicking a PowerShell script from Windows Explorer won't execute it. Also, PowerShell doesn't execute scripts from the current directory.</p>"},{"location":"PowerShell/#setup","title":"Setup","text":""},{"location":"PowerShell/#install-windows-powershell","title":"Install Windows PowerShell.","text":"<p>If you have Windows 7 or later, you don't need to install PowerShell because it comes preinstalled with the OS. If you're using Windows Vista or earlier, you need to download and install PowerShell.</p>"},{"location":"PowerShell/#set-powershells-execution-policy","title":"Set PowerShell's execution policy.","text":"<p>PowerShell is secure by default. The first implication of this philosophy is that PowerShell won't execute scripts until you explicitly give it permission to do so.</p> <p>PowerShell has four execution policies that govern how it should execute scripts:</p> <ul> <li>Restricted. PowerShell won't run any scripts. This is PowerShell's default execution policy.</li> <li>AllSigned. PowerShell will only run scripts that are signed with a digital signature. If you run a script signed by a publisher PowerShell hasn't seen before, PowerShell will ask whether you trust the script's publisher.</li> <li>RemoteSigned. PowerShell won\u2019t run scripts downloaded from the Internet unless they have a digital signature, but scripts not downloaded from the Internet will run without prompting. If a script has a digital signature, PowerShell will prompt you before it runs a script from a publisher it hasn\u2019t seen before.</li> <li>Unrestricted. PowerShell ignores digital signatures but will still prompt you before running a script downloaded from the Internet.</li> </ul> <p>To display the current execution policy, you need to enter the command</p> <pre><code>Get-ExecutionPolicy\n</code></pre> <p>To set the execution policy, enter the command</p> <pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy policy\n</code></pre> <p>One thing that's important to understand about execution policies is the meaning of the phrase \"downloaded from the Internet.\" In Windows, this  phrase means that the file has an alternative data stream that indicates the file was downloaded from the Internet zone. To unblock a script,  right-click the .ps1 file, choose Properties, then click the Unblock  button. </p> <p>Recommend setting for the execution policy is <code>RemoteSigned</code> because this execution policy lets you write and run scripts on your own computer without having to sign them with a code-signing certificate. You'll still be prevented from running a script downloaded from the Internet unless you explicitly unblock it first. To set the <code>RemoteSigned</code> execution policy, enter the following command at a PowerShell prompt:</p> <pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"PowerShell/#run-your-powershell-scripts-keeping-a-few-important-details-in-mind","title":"Run your PowerShell scripts, keeping a few important details in mind.","text":"<p>After configuring the execution policy, you can run PowerShell scripts. To run a script, open a PowerShell window, type the script's name (with or without the .ps1 extension) followed by the script's parameters (if any), and press Enter. In keeping with PowerShell's secure by default philosophy, double-clicking a .ps1 file from Windows Explorer opens the script in Notepad rather than executing the script with PowerShell.</p> <p>To explicitly run a script from the current directory, you must prefix the script's name with .\\ or ./ so that PowerShell understands you intend to run it from the current location. For example, suppose the directory C:\\Scripts isn't in the Path and the following script, named HelloWorld.ps1, exists in C:\\Scripts:</p> <pre><code>Write-Host \"Hello, world\"\nRead-Host \"Press Enter to continue\"\n</code></pre> <p>If you enter these commands at the PowerShell prompt</p> <pre><code>PS C:\\\\&gt; Set-Location C:\\\\Scripts\nPS C:\\\\Scripts&gt; HelloWorld\n</code></pre> <p>PowerShell won't run HelloWorld.ps1, even though the current location is C:\\Scripts. (Note that I included the prompts you'd see, for demonstration purposes. You wouldn't type these prompts when entering the commands.) Instead of the second command, you need to type one of the following commands:</p> <pre><code>PS C:\\\\Scripts&gt; .\\\\HelloWorld\nPS C:\\\\Scripts&gt; ./HelloWorld\n//Run script using path\nPS C:\\&gt; &amp; \"C:\\Program Files\\Scripts\\HelloWorld\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"PowerShell/#sample-code","title":"Sample Code","text":"<pre><code>$message = Read-Host -Prompt 'Message from user'\nWrite-Output \"$message\"\nRead-Host \"Press Enter to continue\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"PowerShell/#tips-and-tricks","title":"Tips and Tricks","text":"<ul> <li>User <code>start-transcript</code> Command in Start to Keep Log of All Activity in that Session</li> <li>Everything in get/set/start/stop/update-Command Format</li> <li>use get-help commandName for help related to That Command</li> <li>use <code>get-help commandName -examples</code> to see Examples related to that command</li> <li>use <code>get-help commandName -online</code> to see examples in Browser</li> </ul>  \ud83d\udca1 **Alias** is Shorthand Version of Command Like cls for Clear-Host,use get-alias to list of all alias"},{"location":"PowerShell/#command-list","title":"Command List","text":"<ul> <li>open file from Powershell : <code>Invoke-Item filepathWithExt</code></li> <li>Change Directory : <code>cd directoryName</code></li> <li>Clear Screen : <code>cls</code></li> <li>Check Version of installed Software : <code>SoftwareName --version</code></li> <li>To get list of Command used in that session use <code>get-history</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"PowerToys/","title":"Fancy Zones","text":""},{"location":"PowerToys/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<ul> <li>for layout i am planning to use grid layout only, layout are categorized depending on number of parts</li> <li>for example 1:1 means 2 column with same size, 1:3 means 2 columns with second one 3 times sizes of first one, additionally can also use 1:1:1 for 3 column setup  </li> <li>Make sure that <code>Override windows snap</code> is checked with , move windows using zone index and move windows between zone across all monitors</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PowerToys/#current-shortcut-setup","title":"Current shortcut Setup","text":"<ul> <li><code>Alt</code> + <code>Tilde</code> to activate fancy zone editor</li> <li><code>Win</code> + <code>Left/Right Arrow</code>  to move active windows between zones</li> <li><code>CTRL</code> + <code>Win</code> + <code>ALT</code> + <code>Layout Shortcut Key (0/1/2/3)</code> to activate different layout</li> <li><code>Win</code> + <code>Up/Down Arrow</code> to switch between normal and  full size windows</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Powerpoint/","title":"Powerpoint","text":""},{"location":"Powerpoint/#shapes","title":"Shapes","text":"<ul> <li>Use Merge shape functionality to add or remove parts</li> <li>Press <code>CTRL</code> while resizing to keep center point fixed</li> <li>Press <code>Shift</code> while resizing to keep aspect ratio</li> <li>Press <code>CTRL</code>+<code>Shift</code> to keep center point and aspect ratio</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Reddit/","title":"Reddit","text":""},{"location":"Reddit/#search-withing-specific-sub-reddit","title":"Search withing specific Sub reddit","text":"<ul> <li>first open your subreddit</li> <li>then search using or for multiple keywords</li> <li><code>python OR  vba OR C# OR automation OR programming</code></li> <li>save this url for future search</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Regular%20Expressions/","title":"Regular Expression","text":""},{"location":"Regular%20Expressions/#what-it-is","title":"What it is?","text":"<ul> <li>It's pattern matching language used to find and extract text</li> <li>for example to find/match all dates in text we can use <code>\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}</code> format to match Data: YYYY-MM-DD pattern</li> <li>Use Case</li> <li>Check validity fo user input<ul> <li>like if user given input is valid email id, licensekey)</li> <li>If given data contain specific info like string contain numbers or symbols</li> <li>Find and Replace text</li> <li>Split Text</li> </ul> </li> <li>Data extraction using pattern matching</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Regular%20Expressions/#how-to-use-it","title":"How to use it?","text":"<ul> <li>Use Regexr website for testing</li> <li>Here is sample code to find all numbers from string</li> <li>If we only use <code>\\d</code> it will print individual number separately like <code>4,2,5,0,0,9,9,9</code></li> <li>That extra <code>+</code> sign allows whole number till next space</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>string text = \"My numbers are 42, 500 and 999\";\nstring pattern = @\"\\d+\";\n\nMatchCollection matches = Regex.Matches(text, pattern);\n\nforeach (Match m in matches)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(m.Value);\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>42\n500\n999\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Regular%20Expressions/#regex-cheat-sheet","title":"Regex Cheat Sheet","text":"<pre><code>.       -

By subtracting (2) from (1) and then expanding, we in fact obtain a linear equation for x and y; after a little rearranging it becomes \u22122x(x1\u2212x2)\u22122y(y1\u2212y2)=(r21\u2212r22)\u2212(x21\u2212x22)\u2212(y21\u2212y22). (If the circles intersect, this is the equation of the line that passes through the intersection points.) This equation can be solved for one of x or y; let's suppose y1\u2212y2\u22600 so that we can solve for y: y=\u2212x+\u2026. Substituting this expression for y into (1) or (2) gives a quadratic equation in only x. Then the x-coordinates of the intersection points are the solutions to this; the y-coordinates can be obtained by plugging the x-coordinates into (3).</p> <p>Easy solution is to consider another plane such that the centers are along an axis.</p> <p>The distance between the centers of the circles is given by </p> <p>Whence</p> <p>The intersection points are given by where R is the distance between the centers of the circles.</p> <p>A nice way to look at this is to first consider the case when one point is at the origin and the other lies on the x-axis.

If x0 also lies on the second circle, which will make it a point of intersection, it must also satisfy the equation of the second circle i.e. (x0\u2212x2)2+(y0\u2212y2)2=r22</p> <p>Substitute the parametric form, and find out the value(s) of \u03b8.</p> <p>Solution to Example 1:</p> <p>Multiply all terms in the first equation by -1 to abtain an equivalent equation and keep the second equation unchanged</p> <p>We now add the same sides of the two equations to obtain a linear equation</p> <p>Which may be written as</p> <p>We now substitute the values of y already obtained into the equation x=9\u22124y to obtain the values for x as follows</p> <p>following the very nice hint of arkeet you can after defining a,b,c,g,h using rc1,zc1,rc2,zc2, as the center point of the circles and R1 and R2 their radii and assuming that rc2!=rc1 (the case where rc2=rc1 can be also done in the manner or arkeet, however the present assumption was useful to me)</p> <p>g = (zc2 - zc1)/(rc2 - rc1); h = (R1R1-R2R2 + zc2zc2 - zc1zc1 + rc2rc2 - rc1rc1 )/(2*(rc2 - rc1));</p> <p>a = (gg+ 1); b = -2gh + 2grc1 - 2zc1; c = hh -2hrc1 + rc1rc1 + zc1zc1 - R1R1;</p> <p>zplus = (-b +sqrt(bb-4ac)) / (2a); zminus = (-b -sqrt(bb-4ac)) / (2a); and rplus = -gzplus+h; rminus = -gzminus+h;</p> <p>you can test this by verifying that the intersection points do lie on the 2 circles.</p>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/","title":"Midas Civil","text":""},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/#quick-links","title":"Quick Links","text":"<ul> <li>Midas Civil Manual</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Basic/","title":"Basic","text":"<pre><code>*UNIT\nTONF,M,BTU,F\n\n*NODE\n1,0,0,0\n2,10,0,0\n3,10,10,0\n4,0,10,0\n\n*ELEMENT\n1,BEAM,1,1,1,2,0,0\n2,BEAM,1,1,2,3,0,0\n3,BEAM,1,2,3,4,0,0\n4,BEAM,1,2,4,1,0,0\n\n*MATERIAL\n1, CONC , M50, 0, 0, , C, NO, 0.05, 1, IS(RC),  , M50, NO, \n\n*SECTION\n1,DBUSER,Main, CC, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, YES, NO, SB,2,1,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n*SECT-PSCVALUE \n SECT= 2,VALUE,Main,CC,0,0,0,0,0,0,YES,NO,GEN,YES,YES\n       2, 0, 0, 0.179127, 1.27021, 0.0710632\n       0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7.83396, 0, 0, 0\n       -0.53, 0.53, 0.3, -0.3, 1.32067, 1.32067, -1.47933, -1.47933\n       OPOLY=-0.6, 1.25067, -0.6, 1.17067, -0.3, 1.07177, -0.3, -1.47933, 0.3, -1.47933\n             0.3, 1.07177, 0.6, 1.17067, 0.6, 1.25067, 0.53, 1.25067\n             0.53, 1.32067, -0.53, 1.32067, -0.53, 1.25067\n\n\n*CONSTRAINT\n1to4,111000\n\n*GROUP\n Main, ,1 2,0\n Dummy, ,3 4,0\n\n*ENDDATA\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/","title":"Midas Civil Files Types","text":""},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#mcb-binary","title":"*.mcb (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>Basic Data file for Midas Civil</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#mct-text","title":"*.mct (text)","text":"<ul> <li>Midas Text file for MCT Command Shell</li> <li>we can export mct file for model using File&gt;Export&gt;mct file</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca1-binary","title":"*.ca1 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>Data file obtained from a static/dynamic analysis process</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca2-binary","title":"*.ca2 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>Analysis results generated for each time step from a time history analysis and a heat of hydration analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca3-binary","title":"*.ca3 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>File for all the data obtained from a moving load analysis, influence line/influence surface and support ettlement analyses</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca4-binary","title":"*.ca4 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>File for all the analysis data generated in the process of a geometric nonlinear analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca5-binary","title":"*.ca5 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>File for all the analysis data generated in the process of a pushover analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#ca6-binary","title":"*.ca6 (binary)","text":"<ul> <li>File for all the analysis data generated in the process of construction stage analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Midas%20Civil/Files/#anl-text","title":"*.anl (Text)","text":"<ul> <li>File containing structural analysis results (reactions, displacements, element forces, stresses, etc.) which has been arranged by the user\u2019s preference.

But there\u2019s a difference when it comes to class accessibility rules \u2013 they don\u2019t apply in the Immediate window. You can call private, protected, and internal members that are not accessible in regular code. In the following example, the GetDiscountForVip() method is private, but I can still call it in the Immediate Window.</p> <p></p> <p>IntelliSense still works as usual, though, and will only show the public methods.</p>"},{"location":"Visual%20Studio/Debugging%20Visual%20Studio/#evaluate-with-no-side-effects","title":"Evaluate with no side effects","text":"<p>Evaluating an expression in the Immediate Window can cause side effects. Variable values can change, and methods can be called. You can interact with a database, with files, and with the network. You can do anything you want, just like in regular code. This behavior isn\u2019t obvious, and not something you always want.</p> <p>For example, consider this class:</p> <p>If you evaluate <code>Foo()</code> in the Immediate Window, <code>number</code> will increase, and the application state will change.</p> <p></p> <p>If that\u2019s not something you want, you can avoid it. Just add the <code>, nse</code> (no side effects) postfix to an expression, and it will evaluate without changing the application state.</p> <p></p> <p>As you may discover, \u201cno side effects\u201d doesn\u2019t work for all expressions. In some cases, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate an expression without side effects. For example, you can\u2019t make a network request in this mode because there\u2019s no way to guarantee that it won\u2019t have side effects.</p>"},{"location":"Visual%20Studio/Debugging%20Visual%20Studio/#access-special-variables-exception-returnvalue-and-user","title":"Access special variables \u2013 $exception, $returnvalue, and $user","text":"<p>Visual Studio uses some special variables during debugging, and the Immediate window can show you their value.</p> <ul> <li><code>$exception</code> evaluates the currently thrown exception. It\u2019s available at the point the exception is thrown, and also in the catch clause if it\u2019s caught. That\u2019s extremely useful in cases that you didn\u2019t add the <code>Exception</code> parameter in the <code>catch</code> clause.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li><code>$returnvalue</code> shows the return value of the currently returned method. This is very useful if you didn\u2019t assign that return value to a variable. In the example below, <code>cashier.PriceAfterDiscount()</code> returned 11. Note that you have to break on the method\u2019s execution line and then step over (with F10) that line of code for <code>$returnvalue</code> to work. If you stepped into the method (with F11), then <code>$returnvalue</code> will be available when you step out. This is the time to make a note of that value because it will be gone as soon as you continue to the next line of code.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>$user shows the current OS user and process information.
