### NSE Percentage of Stocks
- https://in.tradingview.com/script/qQ04TGdJ-NSE-Percentage-of-stocks-above-Moving-Averages/
- This indicator displays the percentage of NSE (India) stocks trading above key moving averages.
- Market breadth measures the degree of participation & the conviction in the overall mood of the underlying index
- A positive market breadth is said to happen when more stocks are advancing than are declining
- When most of the stocks are trading above a specific moving average, the market breadth is termed strong.
- How to Interprete Results
  - We have a bullish bias when >50% of stocks are above their 50-day and 200-day MAs. We have a bearish bias when <50% of stocks are above their 50-day and 200-day MAs.
  - We also look at short-term timeframes (10 & 20 MA) for overbought and oversold levels. Values above 80% are considered overbought and readings below 20% are deemed oversold.
  - Oversold/overbrought market breadth does not necessarily indicate reversal, but rather an exhaustion. This can get resolved by either a price correction or a time correction.
  - The breadth can remain in overbought zones for a long time while the price is in a strong uptrend — and equally so at oversold zones during a strong downtrend.

### NSE Net New Highs
- https://in.tradingview.com/script/W433ezuL-NSE-Net-New-Highs/
- This indicator displays the net number of stocks on NSE (India) making 52-week highs or lows. The count is displayed as a fraction of the total number of stocks in the NSE universe.
- Net New Highs (NNH) are calculated by taking the number of new 52-week highs on any given day and subtracting from it the number of new 52-week lows.
- A market is considered strong (bullish) when NNH are positive, or, in other words, when new highs exceed new lows.
