### NSE Percentage of Stocks
- https://in.tradingview.com/script/qQ04TGdJ-NSE-Percentage-of-stocks-above-Moving-Averages/
- This indicator displays the percentage of NSE (India) stocks trading above key moving averages.
- Market breadth measures the degree of participation & the conviction in the overall mood of the underlying index
- A positive market breadth is said to happen when more stocks are advancing than are declining
- When most of the stocks are trading above a specific moving average, the market breadth is termed strong.
- How to Interprete Results
  - We have a bullish bias when >50% of stocks are above their 50-day and 200-day MAs. We have a bearish bias when <50% of stocks are above their 50-day and 200-day MAs.
  - We also look at short-term timeframes (10 & 20 MA) for overbought and oversold levels. Values above 80% are considered overbought and readings below 20% are deemed oversold.
  - Oversold/overbrought market breadth does not necessarily indicate reversal, but rather an exhaustion. This can get resolved by either a price correction or a time correction.
  - The breadth can remain in overbought zones for a long time while the price is in a strong uptrend — and equally so at oversold zones during a strong downtrend.
