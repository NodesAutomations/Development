Dear Friends,

This database file exchange problem is due to "Access Runtime Driver(ARD)" problem in your respective machines as mention by @Ranjana Shinde is a right answer/solution for all of your questions/problems.

There are several options available to update ARD in your machine, you just google it "Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 & download x86 or x64 bit version" depending upon your machine processor architecture.

Uninstall old version of ARD (2007/2010) & All MS Office Applications (if you are installed) from your machine before going to install ARD 2016.

Now try to install "Microsoft Access Runtime Driver 2016" which you download by above reply by Ranjana Shinde or you can download by links mentioned below in my replay which are from Microsoft Website.

Go to Control panel in your machine & make sure "Microsoft Access Runtime Driver 2016" is installed.

Open RCDC application & Check.

Update for Microsoft Office 2016 (KB4018295) 32-Bit Edition:

[www.microsoft.com/.../details.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56652)

Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable

[www.microsoft.com/.../details.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920)

Also you can try to install Microsoft Access Runtime Driver 2016 using command prompt (DOS) with /quite mode option to avoid any GUI installation problem.

In my machine RCDC is working fine with ETABS 2018.

For any help or assistance you can write a mail to me.
