### Use Case

- Rotate Axis
- Coordinate Transform

### **Basic rotations[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_matrix&action=edit&section=8)]**

A basic rotation (also called elemental rotation) is a rotation about one of the axes of a coordinate system. The following three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle *θ* about the *x*-, *y*-, or *z*-axis, in three dimensions, using the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule)—which codifies their alternating signs. (The same matrices can also represent a clockwise rotation of the axes.[[nb 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#cite_note-3))

For [column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector), each of these basic vector rotations appears counterclockwise when the axis about which they occur points toward the observer, the coordinate system is right-handed, and the angle *θ* is positive. Rz, for instance, would rotate toward the y-axis a vector aligned with the x-axis, as can easily be checked by operating with Rz on the vector (1,0,0):
