### Setup
- for layout i am planning to use grid layout only, layout are categorized depending on number of parts
- for example 1:1 means 2 column with same size, 1:3 means 2 columns with second one 3 times sizes of first one, additionally can also use 1:1:1 for 3 column setup  
- Make sure that `Override windows snap` is checked with , move windows using zone index and move windows between zone across all monitors
