### What is it?

GitHub gist allows you to store code snippets which are version controlled and easily shareable.

### Advantages

- Code snippets can be directly managed from browser
- Automatic Version Control
- Can be easily shared with anyone
- you can share single files, parts of files, and full applications with other people. Directories can't be shared.
- Can be embed to Website or Notion
- people can comment on your work
- Can be shared as website using [https://gist.io/](https://gist.io/)

### Problems

- git can be secret and public but anyone with the link can view your gist

### Search

```csharp
//Try searching with 
user:<username> hello world
```

> 🔥 **Note** Keep all script in to separate Gist to make it easily searchable only Keep related Files in single Gist


> 🔥 **Note** Git hub Gist is just Simplified Git repo, You can clone GitHub gist just like full GitHub repo (This is specially useful when you need to upload binary to GitHub gist)
