# Git Concepts

### Git XL Install command

`git xl install`

### Git Reset

- Used when commit is not pushed to remote
- Erase History of Previous Commits

### Git **Revert**

### Git Stashing

git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
