### Use Task List in Issue
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
```
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:
```

### Link Other Issues
- Additionally you can also create new issues from task list which will also shows if linked issue is open/close.
- you can also drag to reorder task list
- Ref : [Issue](https://github.com/NodesAutomations/Development/issues/4)
```

- [x] #6

```

 ### Automatically close Issue with commit
