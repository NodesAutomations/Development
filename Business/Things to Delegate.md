So i am thinking about all of task that don't require my help but are necessary part of job

### What i want to focus on for next phase
- Get better at coding, do some serious project work
- Create more youtube content

### What i can delegate?
- Upwork scan for job and sending proposal
- Fiverr scan for interesting job or client
- I also want to delicate most simplest type of vba automation project to someone else, so he/she can do it under my name
- Video editing or any other kind of editing for content creation
- Follow up with clients, keep track of everything
- Documentation and training
- Learn each and every detail about project requirement and make sure i code accordingly.
- All office admin stuff like making invoices, collecting payments from client, bank work, keep track of all finance, make sure that we file tax on time or any other legal stuff
- Personal assistant, to manage and keep track of all of my personal finance, manage my calendar to make sure that i maximize my time


### Employee Preferences
- Prefer local, someone I can meet on regular basis
- Salary will be 20K as fresher
- If possible structural engineering background
- Pass out from good college, must have some programming exposure


### Responsibility
- Help me with social media management, manage youtube, linkedin
- Delegate structural engineering projects which involves lot of learning , may we an just do pair programming where he just learn stuff via communicating with client and I just code it out
- Do smaller projects on upwork and fiverr to gain experience![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60865708/219667668-7c0d24b1-bc48-475c-9b63-0e0b724b1ee2.png)
